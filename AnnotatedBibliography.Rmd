abstract: "Current models suggest that Peer-to-Peer lending profitability can be 
  improved with the application of high quality data analysis. The existing body 
  of research generally focused on minimizing the probability of default rather than 
  optimizing for profitability. To encourage the consolidation of knowledge, This 
  bibliography is a source of research and articles from around the web that could
  be used to understand the current state of analysis."

## Introduction
Peer-to-peer lending connects borrowers with investors through an online marketplace. Loans offered through Lending Club are made possible by investors, who invest in exchange for solid returns.

This bibliography classifies articles into one of three categories based on their source and intented audience: academic research, industry analysis, and models 'in the wild'. Industry analysis generally explain a narrowly focused insight through review of specific variable relationships.  Models use by individual investors may methodically review loan attributes and propose further testing approaches.  


## Academic Research  
[@litSerrano]

This article proposes a decision support system for choosing loans optimized for profitability.  This is in contrase to previous literature which focused on modeling default probabilities without considering the increased interest rates to compensate the investor's risk.  The authors proposed using internal rate of return, or IRR, to measure of a loan's profitability.  IRR was chosen because it is able to handle uneven payments at non-uniform intervals.  They created several models predict a loan's IRR as the dependent variable.

## Modeling "In the Wild"  

[@mdlCashorali]


[@mdlDavis]

This analysis is proposes a simple valuation method by weighting the interest rate by the probability of defaulting to arrive at the expected interest rate.  The author used this valuation method along with logistic regression model built to predict the default risk to show that returns can be significantly improved for portfolios with less than 400 loans.  

[@mdlDavenport]

An analysis to understand which attributes are driving Lending Club's interest rates. It includes a brief summary of the components of the FICO score, such as length of credit history and payment history, and how that may be a starting point for identifying confounding variables. The discussion suggests finding local optima of credit risk to interest rate given that LC uses flat interest rates for loan sub grades.  The article was written in 2013 so does not reflect the subsequent changes in LC's scoring model.  

[@mdlDavenport2]

An expansion on the author's earlier analyis but with discussion around challenges in improving the model.  Challenges includes developing meaningful groupings of employement title by overcoming the current diversity in the dataset. 


[@mdlDarre]

An analysis exploring the relationship between many of the loan attributes and the historical default experience.  The author puts forth the analysis as exploratory rather than seeking to answer a specific questions.  Hence, their are only observations and not specific conclusions. The observations include: Default rates decrease with credit history age; higher credit utilization leads to greater risk of default; loan grades are progressively less correlated with the FICO score, presumably, as LC's  rating algorithm improved.

[@mdlOrourke]

A blog post which quickly moves through a cursory exploratory analysis and on to applying machine learning algorithms.  O'Rourke applies two algorithms to Lending Club's historical loan data from 2007-2011: Decision Tree and Logistic Regression.  The author has not developed a hypothesis to test against nor contributed new insights to the body of knowledge. The article is a common form of analysis meant to demonstrate the author's ability to apply a model to a dataset which is a necessary step in the learning process.

[@mdlSummers]

This article takes the first steps in building a model to optimize profitability but falls short by not including lost principle in returns calculation.  The 'loss' of a defaulted loan is the opportunity cost of lost interest and understates the downside risk for a given laon.  

[@mdlToth]

An exploratory analysis of loan attributes and their connection to the loan's outcome. Toth provides a step-by-step write up of how he analyzed data from 2012-2013. The article does not include a summary nor a discussion of the results. An interesting method was to group the loan purposes into three categories: 1) debt, 2) major purposes such as home improvement, and 3) luxury purchase such as vacations and weddings.
