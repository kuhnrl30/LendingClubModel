abstract: "Practitioner models and experimentation suggest that Peer-to-Peer lending
  returns can be improved with the application of machine learning models and high
  quality data analysis. The existing body of models is generally focused improving profitiability 
  by mimimizing the probability of default with minimal research to directly optimize for profitability. 
  To encourage the consolidation of knowledge, I've prepared a resource bibliography
  of analyses, models, and blog posts from around the web that could be used to understand
  the current state of portfolio analysis.\n\nArticles can be classified into one
  of three categories based on their rigor and depth of analysis- elementary, exploratory,
  and explanatory. \n"

## Modeling the Probability of Default


#### Simplistic Models

[@mdlOrourke]

A blog post which quickly moves through a cursory exploratory analysis and on to applying machine learning algorithms.  O'Rourke applies two algorithms to Lending Club's historical loan data from 2007-2011: Decision Tree and Logistic Regression.  The author has not developed hypothesis to test against nor contributed new insights to the body of knowledge. The article is a common form of demonstrating of the author's ability to apply a model, a neccessary step in the learning process.

[@mdlDavenport2]

An analysis to understand which attributes are driving LendingClub's interest rates by creating a model from Lending Club's published dataset. The blog post was written in 2013 so does not reflect any subsequent changes in LC's scoring model.  A brief summary of the components of the FICO score, such as length of credit history and payment history, and how that may be a starting point for idntifying confounding variables. The discussion suggests furthering the knowledge to find local optimizations of credit risk to interest rate give then LC using flat interest rates for loan subgrades.

#### Exploratory  

[@mdlDarre]  
A comprehensive exploratory analysis of the primary variables.  The analysis was a little disjointed the way he moved between the complete dataset and the subset of matured loans. It may have been useful to do them sequentially or enable a left-right comparison.

#### Explanatory  Models 
[@mdlWu1]

Data: June 2015 - May 2016  

**Notes**:

- Response to LC's quarterly earnings release, where LC announced changes in underwriting 
- Used commentary from LC's 10-Q.

**Analysis:**    

- Scatter plot of average DTI for D grade loans by issue date.  The plot attempts to show that less high DTI loans have been issued since LC changed its underwriting in late April 2016. The article hypothesizes that the loans are removed from the direct pay program.  Direct pay requires the loan proceeds be paid directly to the borrower's existing debts.
- Scatter plot of number of inquiries by issue date for F and G grade loans. The plot shows that in the past month there have been less loans with a high number of previous inquiries.
