abstract: "Research and experimentation suggest that Peer-to-Peer lending returns
  can be improved with the application of machine learning models and high quality
  analysis. The existing body of models is focused on identifying and excluding loans
  that will default and therefor improve investor profitability. To encourage the
  consolidation of knowledge, I've prepared a resource bibliography of published analyses,
  models, and blog posts from around the web that could be used to understand the
  current state of portfolio analysis.\n\nArticles can be classified into one of three
  categories based on their rigor and depth of analysis- elementary, exploratory,
  and explanatory. \n"

## Elementary 
[@mdlOrourke]

A blog post quickly moving towards applying machine learning algorithms without first completing a thorough exploratory analysis or defining hypotheses to evaluate results.  In this blog post O'Rourke applies two algorithms to historical loan data from 2007-2011: Decision Tree and Logistic Regression.  The author has not contributed new insights into the Lending Club marketplace and the article is a demonstration of the author's ability to apply a model which is a neccessary step in the learning process.





## Exploratory  

## Explanatory  
[@mdlWu1]

Data: June 2015 - May 2016  

**Notes**:

- Response to LC's quarterly earnings release, where LC announced changes in underwriting 
- Used commentary from LC's 10-Q.

**Analysis:**    

- Scatter plot of average DTI for D grade loans by issue date.  The plot attempts to show that less high DTI loans have been issued since LC changed its underwriting in late April 2016. The article hypothesizes that the loans are removed from the direct pay program.  Direct pay requires the loan proceeds be paid directly to the borrower's existing debts.
- Scatter plot of number of inquiries by issue date for F and G grade loans. The plot shows that in the past month there have been less loans with a high number of previous inquiries.
