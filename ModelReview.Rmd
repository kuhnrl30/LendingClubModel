## Introduction  


## Characteristics of Authors 

The Lending Club data is easily downloaded so attracts blog authors from very diverse backgrounds. Citizen Data Scientists through students in graduate level STEM programs have used the data in some form to produce and publish an analysis. Less experienced authors may use the data to demonstrate their ability to use analytical software such as R or Python whereas academic authors may use the data to demonstrate their grasp of machine learning algorithms. Both groups of authors tend to publish their analysis for demonstrative purposes rather than for profit seeking motives. 



In between these two extremes is the analyst taking a course or series of courses in data science (i.e. a so called bootcamp)

## Varying Analysis Objectives

The analyses can be bifurcated into two general categories based on the author's objective.  The first category is an exploratory analysis of many or all of the variables in the Lending Club dataset and their influence on the default status.

Defined Objective
