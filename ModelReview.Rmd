## Introduction  

Research methods: 
- google searh using terms 'LendingClub', 'Marketplace lending', 'P2P lending'


Brief purpose of analysis


## Characteristics of Authors 

The Lending Club data is easily downloaded so attracts blog authors from very diverse backgrounds. Citizen Data Scientists through students in graduate level STEM programs have used the data in some form to produce and publish an analysis through blog posts and academic papers. Less experienced authors may use the data to demonstrate their ability to use analytical software such as R or Python whereas academic authors may use the data to demonstrate their grasp of machine learning algorithms. In between these two extremes is the analyst taking a course or series of courses in data science (i.e. a so called bootcamp).  These researchers, whether professional or independint, tend to publish their analysis for demonstrative purposes rather than for profit seeking motives.

## Varying Analysis Objectives

The analyses can be bifurcated into two general categories based on the author's objective.  The first category is an exploratory analysis of many or all of the variables in the Lending Club dataset and their influence on the default status. 

Exploratory Analysis
Defined Objective
  - Predict default
  - Effective interest rate
  - 
  
## Observations  

Analytical models developed to predict loan outcomes.
