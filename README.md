# Lending Club Model 

This package is the workspace to develop a model which reduces the note default risk and thereby improve returns.

This package has a few companion packages:
- [Lending Club](http://ryankuhn.net/LendingClub) contains the tools to work with Lending Club's api. It includes functions to query the website and obtain available loans and to view a user's account. The package also contains functions for working with the secondary market.
- [LendingClubData](http://ryankuhn.net/LendingClubData)  documents the process to obtain the historical loan data from the Lending Club website. The data is also contained in the package so it doesn't need to be downloaded repeatedly.
