This package is still in development will be the workspace used to develop models to reduce the risk of purchasing notes that will default and thereby improve earnings.

This package has a few companion packages:
- **Lending Club** contains the tools to work with Lending Club's api. It includes functions to query the website and obtain available loans and to view a user's account. The package also contains functions for working with the secondary market.
- **LendingClubData** documents the process to obtain the historical loan data from the Lending Club website. The data is also contained in the package so it doesn't need to be downloaded repeatedly.
