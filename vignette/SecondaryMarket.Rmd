### Create a Session and Download the Loans 
We have to start this process by logging into the Lending Club website before we can download the data. I've saved my credentials into a .Renviron file for repeated use but you can plug your data into the OpenSession() function however you like.

```{r}
library(P2PLending)
library(dplyr)
email<- Sys.getenv("email")
password<- Sys.getenv("password")

OpenSession(email,password)
dat<- GetSecondaryMarket()
```

### Filtering the Loans
There are usually a lot of loans listed on the secondary market and we won't be interested in most of them. We'll filter the list down based on a few parameters.

```{r}
dat %>$
    filter()
```
