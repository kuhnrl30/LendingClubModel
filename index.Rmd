title: Lending Club Model
---


> This site is my workbench for developing a model to evaluate and choose which loans to invest on the Lending Club platform.  It's continually under development (albeit slower than I wish). 


There are a few companion packages that enable this analysis:  

- **LendingClub**  
    Contains the bindings for Lending Club's api. It includes functions to obtain available loans and to view a user's account. The package also contains functions for working with the secondary market. 

- **LendingClubData**  
    Contains the historical loan data so it doesn't need to be downloaded repeatedly from the Lending Club website. It also documents the process to obtain the  data.

I'm on ORCHID and plan to eventually publish the results of this project.
