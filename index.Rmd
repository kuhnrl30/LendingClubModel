# Lending Club Model 

This package is the workspace used to develop a model which reduces the note default risk and thereby improve returns.

This package has a few companion packages:  

**Lending Club** 
Contains the bindings for Lending Club's api. It includes functions to obtain available loans and to view a user's account. The package also contains functions for working with the secondary market. 

**LendingClubData** 
Contains the historical loan data so it doesn't need to be downloaded repeatedly from the Lending Club website. It also documents the process to obtain the  data.
