# Lending Club Model 

> WARNING: This site is still under development and will be updated from day to day. The LendingClubModel package is a work in process, so please use with caution until this warning is removed. 

This package is the workspace used to develop a model which reduces the note default risk and thereby improve returns. There are a few companion packages that enable this analysis:  

**LendingClub** 
Contains the bindings for Lending Club's api. It includes functions to obtain available loans and to view a user's account. The package also contains functions for working with the secondary market. 

**LendingClubData** 
Contains the historical loan data so it doesn't need to be downloaded repeatedly from the Lending Club website. It also documents the process to obtain the  data.
