This site is the workspace used to develop a model which increases P2P lending profitability. There are a few companion packages that enable this analysis:  

**LendingClub** 
Contains the bindings for Lending Club's api. It includes functions to obtain available loans and to view a user's account. The package also contains functions for working with the secondary market. 

**LendingClubData** 
Contains the historical loan data so it doesn't need to be downloaded repeatedly from the Lending Club website. It also documents the process to obtain the  data.
