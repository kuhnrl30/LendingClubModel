This is in contrase to previous literature which focused on modeling default probabilities without considering the increased interest rates to compensate the investor's risk.  The authors proposed using internal rate of return, or IRR, to measure of a loan's profitability.  IRR was chosen because it is able to handle uneven payments at non-uniform intervals.  They created several models predict a loan's IRR as the dependent variable.},
