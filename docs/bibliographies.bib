Abstract = {Purpose-The objective of this paper is to outline an approach towards a Classification Problem using R. The focus is on two problem statements as stated below: 1. To combine the data on loans issued and loans declined and build model that replicates Lending Club Algorithm closely 2. Using Lending Club's published data on loans issued and its various attributes, build model that can accurately predict probability of delinquency. Design/methodology/approach-In order to build a model which replicates lending club algorithm closely various classification techniques such as Logistic Regression, Basic Classification Trees, Generalized Linear Model with Penalization, Ensemble of Decision Trees and Boosted Trees were used using R. Boosted Trees classification method is deployed to build model that can accurately predict probability of delinquency. Findings-Risk Score variable figures as the top of the variable importance list followed by length of employment as one of the more important varia},

Abstract = {Online Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending has emerged recently. This micro loan market could offer certain benefits to both borrowers and lenders. Using data from the Lending Club, which is one of the popular online P2P lending houses, this article explores the P2P loan characteristics, evaluates their credit risk and measures loan performances. We find that credit grade, debt-to-income ratio, FICO score and revolving line utilization play an important role in loan defaults. Loans with lower credit grade and longer duration are associated with high mortality rate. The result is consistent with the Cox Proportional Hazard test which suggests that the hazard rate or the likelihood of the loan default increases with the credit risk of the borrowers. Finally, we find that higher interest rates charged on the high-risk borrowers are not enough to compensate for higher probability of the loan default. The Lending Club must find ways to attract high FICO score and high-income borrowers in order to s},

Abstract = {The purpose of this article is to see how neural networks are used in credit risk assessment problems. For this, we firstly introduce the main theoretical concepts of the neural calculus, as well as the fundaments for the main training algorithm: the error back-propagation algorithm. We review the specialty literature and find that the neural networks yield better results than other classification techniques, like multivariate discriminant analysis or logistic regression, when applying them in credit risk assessment problems. We focus on a few types of networks: feed-forward networks with multiple layers, fuzzy adaptive networks, support vector machines. We develop an analysis on Romanian Small and Medium Enterprises (financial ratios) and the results are in line with the findings from the literature: the neural networks give better results than the logistic regression. The study can be developed by analyzing a support vector machine or a fuzzy adaptive network. (English) [ABSTRACT FR},

Abstract = {The basic functions of most of the banks are the acceptance of deposits from public and lending funds to public, corporate, etc. This business of lending has brought trouble to individual banks as well as to the entire banking system, thus giving rise to credit risk, which is the risk of default. The present paper is designed to develop an internal credit rating model for banks which improves their current predictive power of financial risk factors. It also studies how banks assess the creditworthiness of their borrowers and how can they identify the potential defaulters so as to improve their credit evaluation. To achieve the above-mentioned objective, a research has been conducted considering the data for the last six years. Altman Z-Score model is used to arrive at an equation of the Z-Score, which helps the banks to predict future defaulters and take necessary action accordingly. The model, which has been developed, is an application of multivariate discriminant analysis in credit},

Abstract = {Well-performing default predictions show good discrimination and calibration. Discrimination is the ability to separate defaulters from nondefaulters. Calibration is the ability to make unbiased forecasts. I derive novel discrimination and calibration statistics to verify forecasts expressed in terms of probability under dependent observations. The test statistics’ asymptotic distributions can be derived in analytic form. Not accounting for cross correlation can result in the rejection of actually well-performing predictions, as shown in an empirical application. I demonstrate that forecasting errors must be serially uncorrelated. As a consequence, my multiperiod tests are statistically consistent. [ABSTRACT FROM PUBLISHER]},
