# Purpose
To compile a list of analyses already performed on the open source data and to learn the interesting relationships discovered in those analyses. 

## Lending club - predicting loan outcomes
[@mdlOrourke]

Data Period: 2007-2011  

**Author Notes**:  

- [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ted-orourke/) shows no background in p2p lending or credit markets.  
- Education at the University of Virginia not yet completed.



**Analysis:**    

- Divided characteristics into two categories: those about the loan and about the borrower.  Did not formally define the groups.
- Filtered out late loans leaving just fully paid, defaulted, and charged off.  Defaulted and charge-off loans combined into a single group.  
- Filtered characteristics by reading the descriptions in the data dictionary. Criteria seems to be intuition and the level of documentation.  There was no analysis for correlation with outcome to support decisions. 
- Chargeoffs focused in higher interest rates, fully paid more evenly distributed  
- distribution of loans by grade  
- 36 vs 60 month loan chargeoff rates  
- Current.Account.Ratio  number of open credit lines divided by total number f accounts 
    
**Modeling:**  

- Decision tree- The AUC from this model was 0.68 but only 60 charge-off loans were correctly identified. After resampling to increase the proportion of charge-offs, the confusion matrix increased to identifying 700 of the 1100 charge-offs.
- Logistic Regression- AUC: 0.697.  Confusion matrix ID'd 730 of the 1100 charge-offs.
- Ensembled- Using bagging
    
**Analysis review:**

- The exploratory analysis was not particularly insightful.  The author did not document the basis for several key decisions such as which variables to include/exclude or why he chose the specific algorithms. The charts were not styled beyond the ggplot defaults.

## Changes in lending club underwriting  

[@mdlWu1]

Data: June 2015 - May 2016  

**Notes**:

- Response to LC's quarterly earnings release, where LC announced changes in underwriting 
- Used commentary from LC's 10-Q.

**Analysis:**    

- Scatter plot of average DTI for D grade loans by issue date.  The plot attempts to show that less high DTI loans have been issued since LC changed its underwriting in late April 2016. The article hypothesizes that the loans are removed from the direct pay program.  Direct pay requires the loan proceeds be paid directly to the borrower's existing debts.
- Scatter plot of number of inquiries by issue date for F and G grade loans. The plot shows that in the past month there have been less loans with a high number of previous inquiries.

## Analysis of Lending Club's data
[@mdlDarre]  

Data: through June 2015.  

**Author Notes**:

- Strong educational background for data science: MSc in Statistics from Stanford University and MSc in Applied Math
- [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jftdarre/) shows work experience as a quant for UBS in structuring CDOs.  

**Data cleaning:**   

- Removed loans where the : 
    - policy code is not 1 meaning they are new products not yet publically available. 
    - high FICO score was 0 meaning the data was not valid.
    - Revolving credit utilization data was missing
    - Low FICO score was less than 600.  Per the new underwriting policy, borrowers with a score less than 600 aren't allowed to receive a loan. 
- New features engineered: 
    - Year from the issue date
    - Buckets for the:
        - FICO scores 
        - years, quarthers, and months of issue dates 
        - number of inquries in the past 6 months
        - DTI
        - Revolving balance
- Filtered to remove loans that have not matured. 
- Grouped statuses into 2 categories: debt and purchases. Credit card and debt consolidation were grouped into the debt category and all others to purchases.
- Simplified the number of delinquencies tp binary: 2+ delinquiries in 2 years.
- Simplified the number of public records to binary: threshold +1.

**Analysis:**    

- FICO score by loan grade showing that most subgrades have average FICO scores within a 10 point range. The initial conclusion is that FICO score doesn't have a linear relationship with the loan grade. Expanded to show density around the average score by year which shows the densities started with a tight distribution around the mean and then widened with time. The ending conclusion is that LC initially relied heavily on the credit score in the loan grading model and then loosened their reliance on it. 
- Look at several variables for a relationship with defaults, loan grades, and fico scores: 


|Variable Name | Conclusion| 
|:----------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
|Home ownership | 'mortgage' defualted at 11.5% and 2% less than other values. No analysis by loan grades  
|Purpose | 'education' and 'small business' have higher charge off rates but education is a very small population. At the total population level, the FICO score does not reflect the higher risk  
|Revolving balance & employment length | no or minimal link to default.  A bump in the charge-off ratio when the employment length is NA which is in contrast to the higher average credit score.  
|Number of delinquencies | Majority of borrowers do not have delinquencies leaving a small population which did. Delinquencies did have a lower average credit grade.  
|Number of open accounts | No clear trend  
|Debt to Income | Author notes a relationship with dti and higher credit score but that does not hold true for scores below 700. 
|Public Records | Small population but a 2% increase in charge-offs if already had a public record.
|Age of credit history | Default rates decrease with credit history age. There was a 5% drop in defaults from borrowers with <6 years to >22 years.  A secondary analysis could be performed to show the impact of borrower age on credit history age. 
|Revolving utilization | Higher usage leads to higher default rates  
|Annual income | High income defaults less, but does not eliminate the risk. Likely a significant variable.    
|Inquiries in 6 months | An indication of desperation to get credit.  7+ inquries are nearly 4x more likely to default than 0 inquiries.  
|Geography | Nevada and Florida are top 2 states for defaults.  



Model Review: 

- A very comprehensive analysis with several appoaces that can be updated and reused. Use of violin charts to show the distribution of credit scores was very effective and can be used fot dti, income, and credit score anakysis.  Plotly pie charts were less effective in transferring information because the default rates by category were embedded in the pop-ups instead of being directly visualized. Having just read Tufte's work, I think the bubble charts were too large to convey so little information and may have been better suited in a table. The analysis was a little disjointed the way he moved between the complete dataset and the subset of matured loans.  It may have been useful to do them sequentially or enable a left-right comparison.

## Lending Club Loan Analysis: Making Money with Logistic Regression

[@mdlDavis]  

Data: through 2011

**Author Notes**:

- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/drjasondavis/?locale=en_US) shows at the time he was the director of Search and Data at Etsy
- PhD in machine learning U of TX- Austin

**Notes**:  

- Interesting discussion in the comments


**Analysis:**    

- Default rate by description character length. He did not define how he measured defaults i.e. did he remove loans that haven't matured yet or were defaults included with the charge-offs.
- Logistic regression using first 50% of loans and evaluated on 2nd 50%.  The model outpout is the probability of default which is then used to weight the interest rate.  12 variables were used in the model with no commentary discussing how they were chosen. 
- Expanded to determine sensitivity of each of the variables by re runnning the model after holding out one of the variables.  Noted that the amount requested had the biggest impact on investor return.  

**Review:**
- An interesting take on the model by flowing it through to a pricing model.  So far in my review the authors have stopped at a classifier model. This is an important shift towards application.

## Analyzing Historical Default Rates of Lending Club Notes  

[@mdlToth]  

Data: 2012-2013

Author Notes:

- Data scientist at Orchard, a 'provider of data, tech and software to the online lending industry'.
- Undergrad at Wharton in stats/finance and a minor in math

Data Cleaning:
- Classified statuses into performing and non-performing.  Current and fully paid went into the performing group and all others to non-performing.
- Removed variables that would not have been known at the time of issuance.
-

Analysis:

- Share of loans performing/non-performing by grade and a further break down by subgrade
- Variable analysis:

|Variable Name | Conclusion| 
|:----------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
Home ownership | prop.test for significance of mortgage vs owners and another for owners vs renters.  Both tests were significant. 
Debt to Income | Bucketed by 10% increments and intuitively states defaults increase as dti increased. 
Revolving Utilization | Bucketed by 10% increments and intuitively states defaults increase as utilization increased. 
Purpose | Calculated stats for each loan but summarized as 3 categories: 1) debt, 2) major purchase such as home improvement and cars, 3) luxury such as vacations and weddings. 
Inquiries | Curve peaking at 3 inq and decreasing again with 4+ inquiries.
Total accounts | He cites a curve peaking at 20 accounts and diminishing effects above that.  There's no analysis documenting the the bin size choice.
Annual Income | Bin by quintiles- top 20% of annual income are 6% more likely to be performing loans. The top cutoff for the top and bottom quintiles was 42K and 95K.
Loan Amount | Binned at 0-15,15-30, and 30-35K.  Noting a decrease in performance for 30-35K loans.  *This contrasts with numbers showing in my Loan Amount exploratory analysis?* 
Employment Length | Binned as NA, <10, >10 years.  No commentary but data suggests 1.25% inprovement for >10 years over <10 years and another 1.25% over NAs. 
Delinquencies past 2 years | Binned to 0, 1, 2, 3+ based on tail of distribution. No difference in 0-2 delinquencies but a fall-off of loan performance at 3+. 
Number Open Accounts | No strong indication
Verifed Income Statements |  Unexpected worse performance as verification status increased. Author suggests confounding variable as verification increases as credit score degraded. 
Public Records | 0, 1, 2+. Better performance at 1+ than 0
Non-Significant Variables | Months since last delinquencies, months since last majore derogatory note, collections in past 12 months

**Review**:
Extensive analysis of many variables. This variable-by-variable format has been used in other blogs but can be very boring to read without a central theme. The variables don't build on each other or follow a line of reasoning. Is ther a better way? Also, there is no analysis of interaction between variables. 

Author proposes a hypothesese for differences in results by variables but there's no testing for confirmation. (and how would you confirm?) Also, minmal documentation around decisions like bin cutoffs.

## Gradient Boosting: Analysis of LendingClub’s Data  
[@mdlDavenport2]

Data: Not stated, but likely through Q1 2013. 

Author Notes: 

- Data scientist at Amazon  
- MS Computer Science from Georgia Tech  

Data Cleaning:

- Replace missing values with NA
- Anova analsysis  listed Amount Requested, Debt/Income Ratio, Rent or Own Home, Inquiries in Last 6 Months, Length of Loan, and Purpose of Loan as being significantly correlated with MeanFICO and Interest Rate. 
- Looked to the credit score info to understand link to other variables  


Modeling: 

- Obejective: predict interest rate using RMSE as accuracy measure  
- Straight to gbm: used to prevent overfitting

Analysis: 

The author presents a fairly simple analysis which has more to do with interpreting the results of the gbm function than actually predicting the interest rates. This model has minimal utility in predicting default probability or expected cash flow from a loan. There are two possible insights from the blog post: 

1) Loans have already been priced by the time they are on the market but it may be useful to understanding how loans were priced.  You could then make a local optimization argument that there are arbitration gains where the interest rate doesn't reflect risk.  The author did not attempt to explore, much less prove, that line of thinking. 
2) Composition of the FICO score is a combination of amounts owed, payment history, credit mix, length of credit history, and new credit. This is a good starting point to identify confounding or high correlation variables.

## Lending Club Data Analysis Revisited with Python  
[@mdlDavenport]  

Data: 

Author:

- see above

Cleaning:

- Question relationships to identify risks, but no proposed solutions  or conclusions without confirmation or analysis. 
- ID these risks:

|Variable Name | Risk| 
|:----------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Employment Title | Too many unique values to include as variable.  Need to group somehow. |
| Employment Length | May confuse buying power,  Job tenure doesn't indicate purchasing power. |
| Earliest credit line | Longer period could indicate age and earning potential. 


Analysis:
- Objective was to predict interest rate
- Explorarorty analysis was generally just distributions

# Trends and organization  

- 3 tranches: ML demo, exploratory analysis, and practical application
    - ML demo: casual analysis and then quickly move to applying ML algorithm.  Some feature engineering, but they don't tend to be helpful variables 
    - Exploratory: product of a course or bootcamp.  Showing relationship of multiple variables.  No resulting model or classifier.
    - Practical application: Blog posts from investment service firms.  Show deep knowledge of the industry but are not a complete and comprehensive review of all variables.  Tend to be a deep dive on a very narrow topic. Likely useful for understanding the nuance of the market but not for getting started.   
    
- Approach for those with DS experience is to go variable by variable and look for the effect. Practitioners tend to focus o current events and the impact on the current credit scoring model.
